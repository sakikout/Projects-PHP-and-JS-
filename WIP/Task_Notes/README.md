Salutations, stranger!

# The WIP folder
It is a note for every work in progress here. They might look very confuse and ugly right now, but it is because it is actually not done, of course. I am always changing
it as well, so that is why it might look even more weird than an usual WIP. Soon, I might add the comments. :)


## The Projects
### Task Site
The first one in `Task_Notes` is a very common and basic site for beginners in Web Dev: it is basically a site where you can add chores, as a To Do List. 
Actually, a "To Do List" is very useful for agile methodoligies, such as Kanban, where I particularly got the idea of "Priority Level"!

In my opinion, there are 3 most important things in this project:
  - Inputs: the name and a little description of the chores;
  - Submit and Delete buttons: where you can pass the information and delete an older task;
  - Divs: where the tasks you inserted will be shown;
  
Anyway, it is a really good and fun project to do to start understanding the DOM and JavaScript, and it is always different from one
to another.
